SimpleRockets Evaluator
=======================

This app calculates the center of gravity of a given rocket, and
eventually, probably, a portion of that rocket.

You can use this to optimally place RCS engines.

That's...pretty much it.

Sidenote: 
I went with [Bottle](http://bottlepy.org/) becuase I try to use a
new framework whenever I make a little app like this, I'm currently
on a Python kick, and have heard good things.  It was this or Flask,
and I liked Bottle's docs better.  Flask will get its day I'm sure.
